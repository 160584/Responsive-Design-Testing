# Responsive Design Testing
This tool is for everyone who needs a quick and easy way to test their website design in multiple screen widths.

Simply change the *defaulURL* variable at the top of the responsive.js file to your own site.

Once you've uploaded, you can navigate your website from within the iframes, and the others will update.

This won't work for external sites however due to browser security restrictions.

Enjoy ;-)
